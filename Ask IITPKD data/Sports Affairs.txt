Sports Affairs
Though a newly established premier institute, it would not be an overstatement to say that IIT Palakkad has been successful in laying a solid foundation for sports. IIT Palakkad participated for the first time in Inter IIT in its 51st edition and secured a respectable 13th position out of all the 23 IITs.
The institute has a dedicated Sports Council to oversee all the Sports Activities that take place in the institute. The aim of the council is to create a conducive environment where Sports become an integral part of every individual's schedule. The Sports Council makes sure that every sports enthusiast will be served with facilities, opportunities and content.

In order to motivate the students and seek their interest in sports, a special scheme of NSO (National Sports Organisation) has been put into effect. We have adequate facilities available on the campus for both outdoor and indoor sports for the students to practice their respective sports. Sportsmen are trained by experienced coaches for tournaments such as Inter IIT.

     

       The Sports Council conducts enough Intra IIT tournaments such as Sportacus, Inter Hostel competitions and Interbranch competitions in various sports to keep students engrossed in Sports activities and provide them with enough opportunities to bring out the sportsperson in them!
