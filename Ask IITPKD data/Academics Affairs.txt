Academics Affairs
Academics play a central role in any studentsâ€™ college life; and at a premiere institute such as an IIT, the academic life becomes all the more important to the development of a budding engineer or a scientist or a start-up innovator. Therefore, it becomes utmost important for the students to have a representative with regards to the academics of the institute.
And, for the same, the elected Academic Affairs Secretary carries the principal responsibility of looking out for the interests of all the students concerned and to help or suggest actions with whatever issues faced by any of the student community and in nurturing and supporting a healthy academic life for students.The secretary is also primarily concerned with disseminating any information on academic matters that is crucial to the knowledge of the student body. The Career Development Centre, CDC, works with the Academic Affairs Secretary, along with a training and placement officer, faculty advisors, and branch representatives constituting the team.
Currently, the Academic Affairs Secretary also overlooks the recently formed alumni association of IIT Palakkad. The alumni association of IIT Palakkad was registered on July 26, 2019, aiming to nurture and maintain good relationships with our alumnus even after graduation. With Students' Advisor and a faculty (currently, Dr. Lakshmi Narasimhan) as advisors, the team now has an Alumni Head and further team members are being selected (formation of remaining team is being held now)
The Secretary also works closely with Dean, Academic Research, besides Dean, Academics, to provide better guidance and infrastructure to the students who are interested in further studies. Dean, Academics can be contacted at the following emails :
