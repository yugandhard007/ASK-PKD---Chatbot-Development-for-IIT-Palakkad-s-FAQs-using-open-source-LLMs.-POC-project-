Hostel Affairs
We, at IIT Palakkad, firmly believe that a good, nurturing environment leads to the better productivity of all the students concerned. Which is why, the Hostel Affairs Council, headed by the Hostel Affairs Secretary, is dedicated to make the environment of all the hostels conducive to better productivity and innovation.

Currently, we are located across two different campuses viz the Ahalia Campus and the Nila Campus, with three hostels spread across each campus, taking the total count to 6 hostels.

The hostels in the Nila campus are

                1. Bageshri

                2. Brindavani

                3. Tilang

The hostels in the Ahalia campus

Hostel 1
Hostel 2
Hostel 3
Hostel 4
Hostel 5
Each of the above hostels has a representative to better present the problems faced by the students of the particular hostel regarding the hostel and the mess to the Hostel Council, hence making it easier for students to report their problems as well. In order to make the system more fluidic, there is also a temporary campus representative in the Ahalia campus, who overlooks all the issues that may be faced by the students and helps the Hostel Affairs Secretary to understand them better.
 

The mess in both the campuses is currently operated by Sakthiâ€™s Kitchen Pvt Ltd. The issues regarding the mess are regularly deliberated upon every month in the presence of the associated representatives of the mess and student mess representatives as well. Also, there is an Amenity Centre in the Nila campus and a canteen in Ahalia Campus to cater to the day to day needs of the students as well as faculty.

If there are any complaints/suggestions regarding the mess, kindly fill out this form.
